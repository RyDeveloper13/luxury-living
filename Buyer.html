                <h2>Why Do You Want To Buy?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>Purchasing a property is most likely the biggest financial decision you will ever make. Whether this is your first purchase or you are an experienced buyer, this decision must be made carefully.</p>
                    <p>Are you tired of paying rent? Have you decided to pay your own mortgage and not your landlordâ€™s? Have you outgrown your current home? Are you looking for an investment portfolio? Are you looking for a rental property? Would you like a larger yard? Would you rather live in a different area? Do you want to shorten your commute? Having a clear sense of your reasons for buying will help you choose the right property.</p>

                <h2>Preparing To Buy</h2>
                <h3>Build Your Green File</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>A green file contains all your important financial documents. You will need it to secure financing for your property. The typical green file should contain: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Financial statements</li>
                        <li> Bank accounts</li>
                        <li> Investments</li>
                        <li> Credit cards</li>
                        <li> Auto loans</li>
                        <li> Recent pay stubs</li>
                        <li>Tax returns for two years</li>
                        <li>Copies of leases for investment properties</li>
                        <li>401K statements, life insurance, stocks, bonds, and mutual account information.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <h3>Check Your Credit Rating</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Your credit score will have a huge impact on what type of property you can buy, and at what price. It is first recommended to check your credit rating with an experienced lending institution so that we can determine what you can afford. The lender will research your credit ratings from the three credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. We will be happy to recommend experienced, knowledgeable lenders in the residential, construction, and commercial and investment real estate fields.</p>
                </ul>
                <h3>Time to Buy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Once you have picked out the property you want to purchase, your real estate agent can help you make an offer that the seller will accept. A good agent will investigate the potential costs and expenses associated with the new property. An agent can also help you draft your offer in a way that gives you the advantage over another offer.</p>
